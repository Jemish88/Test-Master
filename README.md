# Spring Boot Testing Guide

## Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive guide to implementing various testing techniques in a Spring Boot application. It covers unit testing, integration testing, and in-memory testing using JUnit and Mockito.

## Technologies and Components

### 1. JUnit

- **Overview**: JUnit is a widely used framework for writing and running tests in Java applications.
- **Common Annotations**:
  - `@Test`: Marks a method as a test case.
  - `@BeforeEach`: Runs before each test method; useful for setup.
  - `@AfterEach`: Runs after each test method; useful for cleanup.
  - `@BeforeAll`: Runs once before all tests in the class.
  - `@AfterAll`: Runs once after all tests in the class.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @BeforeEach
  void setup() {
      // Initialization code here
  }

  @Test
  void testMethod() {
      // Test logic here
  }

### 2. Mockito

- **Overview**: Mockito is a mocking framework that allows you to create mock objects for your tests.

- **Common Annotations**:
  - `@Mock`: Creates a mock instance of the class.
  - `@InjectMocks`: Injects mock instances into the class under test.
  - `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`: Enables Mockito in JUnit 5 tests.

- **Key Methods**:
  - `when(...)`: Specifies the behavior of a mock.
  - `verify(...)`: Confirms that a method was called on a mock.
  - `doNothing()`, `doThrow()`: Control the behavior of void methods.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

  public class TaskServiceTest {
      @Mock
      private TaskService taskService;

      @InjectMocks
      private TaskController taskController;

      @Test
      void testServiceMethod() {
          when(taskService.getTaskById(1L)).thenReturn(new Task());
          // Assertions here
          verify(taskService).getTaskById(1L);
      }
  }

### 3. In-Memory Testing with H2

- **Overview**: In-memory testing uses an in-memory database (like H2) for running integration tests without a real database. This approach is useful for testing data access layers while keeping the tests fast and isolated.

- **Usage**: Configure H2 in the application properties for testing purposes. Spring Boot will automatically use this configuration during tests.

- **Example Configuration**:
  ```properties
  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
  spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
  spring.datasource.username=sa
  spring.datasource.password=password
  spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop

## Testing Strategies

- **Unit Testing**: Focus on testing individual methods or components. Use Mockito to mock dependencies and isolate the unit of work.

- **Integration Testing**: Tests multiple components together, typically using a real or in-memory database to validate interactions.

- **End-to-End Testing**: Tests the complete flow of the application, including controllers, services, and repositories.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a practical overview of how to implement and utilize JUnit, Mockito, and in-memory testing in Spring Boot. Understanding these concepts enhances code quality and reliability through effective testing strategies.
